# Sky-View
Passion Project &lt;3

A 2-day passion project, from week-3 of the second phase of Dev Bootcamp

There's a profound joy I get from viewing sky events (day or night), 
that is incredibly humbling. 

My hope is to share that curiosity and wonder with the public.

It's common that people aren't aware when these events occur, 
at what time, or even if it will be visible to them. My hope is that my
app will inspire sky watchers around the globe.
